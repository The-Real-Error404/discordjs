# discordjs
Here are some old discord.js files from around 8 months ago. Some are without a command handler, so perfect examples for beginners! 

Reading the discord.js docs always helps. These files are all around the place and from bots using different types of command handlers as well.

Note: This is not the code used in my primary/custom bots.
