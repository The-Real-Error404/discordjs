# discordjs
Here are some old discord.js files from around 8 months ago. Some are without a command handler, so perfect examples for beginners! 

Reading the discord.js docs always helps. These files are from bots using different types of command handlers as well.

Note: This is not the code used in my primary/custom bots.
